# LLM Mastery

This notebook is a collection of notes and coding execersies a variety of topics regarding LLM applications to become a professional LLM developer and Researcher.

Books Include: 
• Designing Large Language Model Applications - Suhas Pai. 

This lays the foundations of building and deploying LLM applications in a professional environment and serves as a reference for future development of LLM applications. 

The intention of this code is to hone my skills and become an LLM developer. As such, there are examples of code for building an end to end LLM application, with fine tuning, prompt engineering, and deployment. All code will likely be annotated for my own learning and to help you understand should you wish to use this code as a learing resource. 

Here's to maxing out my credit card on GPU credits and scraping wikipedia for data.
